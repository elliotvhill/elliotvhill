# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elliot.

I am a web developer and junior software engineer with over **10 years of experience** in customer service.

**In 2023**, I graduated from a full stack **software engineering boot camp**, where I gained experience with the latest front- and back-end programming languages, tools, and methodologiesâ€”including **HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Node.JS, React.JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, SQL, Python, and Django**â€”and completed a number of projects focused on the real-world applications of web development principles and best practices.

In my previous role as an enterprise customer support representative, I developed a strong **customer-centric mindset**, facilitated cross-functional communication between product and engineering teams, and **consistently exceeded expectations** in customer satisfaction and business retention.

With a broad background in customer service, political science, and **diversity and inclusion leadership**, I approach all projects through a lens of **accessibility, equity, and integrity**.

***These days I'm more active over on GitLab: [check me out there](https://gitlab.com/elliotvh)!***

### Jumpy Jumper JavaScript Platformer Game
#### <a href="https://github.com/elliotvhill/fcc-platformer-game" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> | <a href="https://jumpy-jumper.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Live site</a>
A simple platformer game built for freeCodeCamp's _[JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)_. Players can use arrow keys and the spacebar to reach platforms and three checkpoints. Uses the Web Animations API to animate frames.

<br />

### Rove Curious
#### <a href="https://github.com/elliotvhill/Rove_Curious_NASA_API" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> | <a href="https://rove-curious.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Live site</a>
Browser-based web app built with vanilla Javascript that uses RESTful Axios API calls to pull images from NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover Photos API. As a first project, the goal was to use DOM manipulation, event listeners, and API calls to craft an app using minimal HTML.

<img alt="Screenshot of the Rove Curious app" src="https://github.com/elliotvhill/elliotvhill/blob/144d2f962753f66bc3237975b4d581d3b5a3a69d/Rove-Curious.png" height=50% width=50% />
<br />

### DALL-E-Dazzle
#### <a href="https://github.com/Adrienx/DALL-E-Dazzle" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>
Full Stack AI application built using the MERN stack and OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E API. Users can enter a text prompt to create an AI-generated image and save to a cloud gallery via Cloudinaryâ€™s RESTful upload image API. The app uses React state and context to iterate upon an original prompt and improve the images.
